# Project Context: foxisdog.github.io

## Project Overview
This directory contains the source for the personal homepage of Hojun Lee, intended to be hosted via GitHub Pages (`foxisdog.github.io`).
Currently, the repository is in an initial setup phase, containing primarily minimal documentation.

## Directory Structure
- **README.md**: Identifies the project as "Homepage of Hojun Lee".
- **GEMINI.md**: This context file.

## Usage & Development
As a User/Organization GitHub Pages repository, the `master` or `main` branch usually serves the website content.
- **Current Status**: No HTML or static site generator configuration is present.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Create an `index.html` file to establish a landing page.
    - Alternatively, initialize a static site generator (like Jekyll, Hugo, or React/Next.js) for more complex content management.

## Key Commands
Since there are no build scripts configured yet:
- **Serving Locally**: Standard static file servers (e.g., `python3 -m http.server`, `npx serve`) would be used to preview content once added.
